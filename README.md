# Simulation of telemetry signals of a car using Py-synthpop library
This repository contains code for simulation of telemetry data of a car using Py-synthpop library.
Py-synthpop library is the Python implementation of the R package synthpop.The R implementation of synthpop is  a tool for producing synthetic versions of microdata. Variables are synthesised one-by-one using sequential regression modelling.  This means that conditional distributions, from which synthetic values are drawn, are defined for each variable separately.
